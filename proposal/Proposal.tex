\title{Live Path Refinement through Probabilistic Rules}
\author{Taylor Lloyd}

\maketitle

\section{Motivation}
    GPS sensor inaccuracies are well-known in existing literature, and multiple techniques exist for refining GPS data, and interpolating between GPS readings.
    However, existing work tends either to focus on efficiently modelling probabilities as gaussian distributions~\cite{} or deterministically map positions onto a network~\cite{}.
    Little work, however, focuses on the properties of the objects being tracked by GPS. By constructing rules as continuous probabilities over a (position, velocity) state space, and propagating (position, velocity) forward through time, one can construct a more accurate path than by using GPS sensors alone.

\section{Background}
    The Edmonton Transit System~(ETS) makes near-realtime position information available for all active ETS busses.

\section{Related Work}
  Path Interpolation

  Kalman Filters

  Map-Matching

\section{Proposal}

Read in ETS information

Propagate forward 4D snapshots in time to present

Continuous probabilities can be approximated by linear-interpolation lattice

Conditionally apply rules: (on roads (speed limits), on routes)

\section{Evaluation}

Focus on recoverability, not equality.

Average Most-Likely Error Area when permuting input coordinates

\section{Expectations}

Visual presentation on map of Edmonton.

Ability to toggle rules and assumptions (on roads, on routes, etc)
