\section{Evaluation}

\taylor{Describe input data}
\taylor{Describe experimental setup}

\subsection{Processing Time}
\taylor{Faster better, but hard constraint: must keep up with world}
\taylor{describe Grid fidelity importance}
\taylor{Describe recoverability}
\taylor{describe sources of error}

\taylor{generate and reference graph}
\taylor{describe error metric: difference at each timestamp}
\taylor{Show 256*256 as apparent sweet spot}

\subsection{Route Recoverability}
\taylor{Describe assumed GPS unreliability}
\taylor{random permutations to location, scaling distance}
\taylor{compare distance between original/permuted locations vs original/permuted grid locations}

\taylor{generate and reference graph}
\taylor{discuss reasons for failure: error magnification}
\taylor{discuss reasons for failure: falling off grid}
