\section{Background}

\subsection{GPS Positioning}
\input{figures/fig-gps-how}

GPS Positioning technology makes use of satelites in known orbits around the earth, broadcasting the current time. By consulting the orbits and the time taken for a signal to arrive from a number of satelites, GPS recievers can determine their own location on Earth, as shown in \figref{fig:gps:how}.

\input{figures/fig-reflect}

However, GPS cannot produce perfectly precise locations. Error is introduced by a variety of factors: Orbital information can be out-of-date or subtly incorrect, or too few satelites may be within reach. \figref{fig:gps:reflect} shows a more dramatic problem, in which the signal recieved is bounced off a nearby object before being received.
