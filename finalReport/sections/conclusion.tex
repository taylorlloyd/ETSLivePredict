\section{Conclusion}

As presented, probability meshes for sensor refinement are not suitable for managing error in GPS positions at the scale of a full city. At sizes that can be processed in real time, the fidelity of the mesh is too poor to meaningfully improve over raw sensor positions, and at sizes that can produce high-quality results processing is too slow to keep up with incoming data.
