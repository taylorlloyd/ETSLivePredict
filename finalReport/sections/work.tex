\taylor{Resummarize work as agenda}

\section{Probability Grid}

\taylor{Detail problem of discretizing continuous probs}
\taylor{cite original 2d grid work}
\taylor{discuss extension to 4d to include velocity}

\taylor{Discuss 2-way mapping from grid to real-world}
\taylor{Discuss implementation of linear interpolation}
\taylor{Discuss benefits/drawbacks of linear interpolation=>max/min at point}

\section{Probabilistic Rules}

\taylor{Discuss ability to represent knowledge of objects being tracked}
\taylor{Contrast to Kalman Filters, which can only represent Gaussians}
\taylor{Provide examples: Vehicles drive on roads, in the correct direction, people near their home not moving are in their homes}
\taylor{Emphasize probability to allow rules that are sometimes wrong}

\subsection{Road Matching}

\taylor{Discuss and cite data source (OSM)}

\taylor{Give function over minimum road distance}

\taylor{Efficiently calculating minimum road distance}
\taylor{discuss roads: sequence of segments}
\taylor{discuss index implementation - each road in each grid cell it crosses}
\taylor{discuss index query - need query point + neighbors (nearest q, not overlap q)}

\section{Grid-Based Trajectory Refinement}

\taylor{summarize how grids + rules can combine information}

\subsection{Forward Estimation}

\taylor{Describe example point in grid with velocity moving forward}
\taylor{provide math for pointwise update}

\subsection{GPS Sensor Integration}

\taylor{Describe sensor input, gaussian centered around point}
\taylor{Cite error distribution again}
\taylor{provide math for pointwise integration}
\taylor{Call out mult as pointwise AND}

\subsection{Rule Integration}

\taylor{Call back to sensor integration}
\taylor{Note equation compatibility with any probability rule}
\taylor{Summarize use of OSM Road Matching}
